**Job Recommendation System**

This project aims to build a machine learning-based job recommendation system that provides personalized job recommendations based on user profiles and job descriptions. By leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) and recommendation algorithms, the system matches job seekers with relevant job opportunities, enhancing the job search experience.

*Features:*
User Profile Matching: Uses features like skills, experience, and interests to match users with suitable jobs.  
NLP for Job Descriptions: Extracts and processes key information from job descriptions to make accurate recommendations.  
Recommendation Algorithm: Employs collaborative filtering or content-based filtering for personalized job recommendations.  
Interactive Interface: Built using Streamlit for user-friendly job search and filtering options.

*Technologies:*
1.Python  
2.NLP (spaCy/TF-IDF)  
3.Machine Learning (Scikit-learn)  
4.Streamlit (for UI)  
5.Pandas, Numpy (for data manipulation)  
6.Git for version control
